A value of 0 On Time is a special mode where the lights are constantly sent a command to turn them on whenever motion is detected. EZMotion will NOT turn the lights off in this mode. Note that this mode will significantly shorten battery life.<BR/>

			<Label lang="en">Light Threshold</Label>
			<Help lang="en"><![CDATA[Light Threshold is the percentage of light in the room above which the lights will not be turned on. Light Threshold is often used in room with a lot of natural daylight. Setting Light Threshold to a value of 50% will cause EZMotion to not turn the lights on when the natural light in the room is already at the 50% value. This feature only prevents the lights from coming on when motion is first detected and the light level in the room is already above Light Threshold. It will not turn the lights off when the amount of natural light in the room increases. It will automatically turn on the lights in a room that has motion in it and that the amount of natural light has dropped below Light Threshold.<BR/>
A value of 100% turns off this feature.<BR/>
Recommended values:<BR/>
Usually a value between 40% and 60% will prevent the lights from coming on in a reasonably well light room and will turn them on as it is getting dark. Some experimentation is required with each room to determine the proper setting.]]></Help>

			<Label lang="en">Stay Awake</Label>
			<Help lang="en"><![CDATA[Setting Stay Awake to a non-zero value will cause EZMotion to always be awake. NOTE: this mode should NOT be used when EZMotion is battery powered! Batteries will only last a few days in this mode.<BR/>
Stay Awake is NOT set to the factory default (0) when EZMotion is Excluded (reset) from the Zigbee network.<BR/>
Setting Stay Awake to a non-zero value will cause the Zigbee Listening Bit to be set. EZMotion will become a routing node in the Zigbee Mesh-Network when the Listening Bit is set.<BR/>
To properly have EZMotion included in the routing tables, set Stay Awake to a non-zero value, then reset EZMotion (Exclude from the network), then add it back to the network. The new routing information will be used now that the listening bit is set.]]></Help>
